Machine learning has become a critical tool in modern data-driven applications.
This research explores the use of supervised learning models to predict student
career pathways based on expected salary, work-life balance, and job satisfaction.
The study uses survey data collected from undergraduate students and applies
regression and classification techniques to identify trends.

The methodology includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model
evaluation using accuracy and F1-score. Results indicate that expected salary
and work-life balance are strong predictors of career preference.
